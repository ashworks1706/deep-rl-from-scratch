# deep-rl-from-scratch

I wanted to learn deep reinforcemet learning from the very core level which is why i created this notebook as in the form my notes, though i can't cover all the concepts, I've just picked up DDPG and DQNs to be explained thoroughly with their background theory and math behind it as well as code implementation.

Hopefully this is helpful to you guys, Thanks!
